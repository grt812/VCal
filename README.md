# VCal

VCal is an open-source calendar application developed by three students at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in collaboration with the Rensselaer Center for Open Source. Our goal is to provide an intuitive calendar experience for students and programmers, focusing on minimizing input to enhance user experience. The app offers features such as keyboard shortcuts, drag-and-drop event scheduling, expansion, and basic language processing to facilitate effortless calendar management.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
