Introduction
The objective of this formative usability test is to assess how user friendly is the current design of the login page for the calendar website and how efficient the main calendar UI is. Since the user group of this website is super users who are looking for tools that would make their calendar making process more smooth and more efficient. We screened the user to get the correct user group. Due to the tight schedule we will only test 3 participants, but it should point out about 60% of the problems. 

Participant Screening 

Q1: On a scale of 1-10, typically how comfortable are you navigating websites?
Note:Participants are disqualified if they answer below 5.

Q2: Share your experience with a calendar app or website.
Note:Participants that don't have related experiences disqualify. 

Q3: On a scale of 1-10, how often do you explore different ways to complete a task more efficiently?
Note:Participants are disqualified if they answer below a 5

Q4: On a scale of 1-10, what is your feeling toward the calendar app/website you are using(1 being very unsatisfied, 10 being very satisfied)?
Note:Participants that responded with an 8 or higher are automatically disqualified. Since our calendar has a learning curve, if the user is already very comfortable with an existing calendar app then there is no point in switching to a new one.
